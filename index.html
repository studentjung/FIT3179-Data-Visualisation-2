                <h2>Future Land Use</h2>
                <p class="top-p"><b>Melbourne</b> continues to experience steady population growth, with its suburbs expanding to accommodate increasing housing demand and evolving community needs. Understanding how <span class="landuse-text">land use</span> is planned, and where growth is occurring, offers valuable insight into the city's <b>development priorities, spatial distribution, and long-term sustainability</b>. This visualisation explores the <b>relationship between urban planning and population change</b> across Melbourne's suburbs.</p>
                <p>The <b>choropleth map</b> illustrates the <em>percentage of land area</em> in each suburb near the <b>Melbourne CBD</b> that is allocated to different future <span class="landuse-text">land uses</span>. The <b>stacked bar chart</b> complements this by showing the <em>absolute area</em> (in km²) of planned land for each <span class="landuse-text">land use</span> category, allowing clear comparison of how <span class="resid-text">residential</span>, <span class="infra-text">infrastructure</span>, <span class="indus-text">industrial</span>, <span class="commu-text">community</span>, and <span class="open-text">open space</span> allocations differ across suburbs. Both charts include interactive options to select land use types or reorder suburbs by total area, enabling focused exploration of planning trends.</p>
                <p><b>Tarneit</b> exhibits one of the highest proportions of planned development, with nearly all of its area already allocated to future land uses. The <b>Rockbank - Mount Cottrell</b> region contains the <b>largest absolute planned land area (≈ 40.56 km²)</b>, highlighting its role as a major growth corridor in Melbourne's west. In contrast, <b>Wallan</b> shows no planned <span class="indus-text">industrial</span> land use, suggesting a more <span class="resid-text">residential</span> or mixed-use development strategy.</p>

                <p class="top-p"><b>Melbourne's</b> suburbs continue to evolve alongside the city's expansion, with population growth shaping where future development occurs. This <b>treemap visualisation</b> provides an overview of suburban populations in <b>2024</b>, focusing on areas identified for planned land use. Each rectangle represents a suburb, grouped by its broader <em>SA3 region</em>, with area size proportional to total population — larger blocks indicate more residents.</p>
                <p>The <span id="wdynham-text">Wyndham</span> region stands out with the <b>highest population</b> among the emerging development corridors, reflecting its rapid transformation and strong residential growth. Similarly, the <span class="tull-text">Mickleham - Yuroke</span> area within <span class="tull-text">Tullamarine - Broadmeadows</span> records the <b>largest overall population</b> among established regions, signalling a balance between mature infrastructure and continuing expansion.</p>
                <p>Conversely, <span id="sunbury-text">Sunbury</span> maintains the <b>smallest population footprint</b> within these growth areas, highlighting its semi-rural character and limited current development. Within the <span class="melb-text">Melbourne City region</span>, the <span class="melb-text">Flemington Racecourse</span> area shows the <b>lowest population density</b>, largely due to land reserved for non-residential use.</p>
                <p>Together, these population patterns reveal how <b>urban density and development priorities</b> vary across Melbourne's suburban landscape — offering insight into where the city's next phase of growth is most likely to occur.</p>

                <p class="top-p">The relationship between <b>population change and future land use</b> offers insight into how Melbourne's urban form continues to evolve. These <b>scatterplot visualisations</b> compare total planned land use area against key drivers of population growth — <em>natural increase</em>, <em>net internal migration</em>, and <em>net overseas migration</em> — to highlight where planning activity is most responsive to demographic pressure.</p>
                <p>Trends for <b>natural increase</b> and <b>net internal migration</b> show a clear positive correlation with total planned land use across the suburbs, while <b>overseas migration</b> displays a slight negative correlation, with a few notable outliers such as <b>Rockbank - Mount Cottrell</b> and <b>Wallan</b>. The majority of Melbourne's recent population growth has been driven by internal migration, particularly towards growth corridors in the west and north where large-scale housing developments are underway.</p>
                <p>Overall <b>population size</b> varies widely between suburbs but shows limited correlation with planned land use area. However, <span class="landuse-text">population density</span> tends to decline as the total planned land use area increases, implying that urban expansion is occurring through <em>low-density greenfield development</em> rather than higher-density infill. This reflects Melbourne's continued outward growth pattern, consistent with planning priorities in areas like <b>Wyndham</b> and <b>Melton - Bacchus Marsh</b>.</p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p><b>Melbourne</b> continues to grow steadily, with major <b>land use planning</b> focused on outer suburbs like <b>Tarneit</b> and <b>Rockbank - Mount Cottrell</b>, key hubs of low-density expansion. The <b>Wyndham</b> region leads in population growth, driven mainly by <b>internal migration</b>. Overall, population density declines as planned land use increases, reflecting Melbourne's outward, <em>greenfield-focused</em> development pattern.</p>
